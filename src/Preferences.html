                <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
                <p>
                    My goal is to become a successful developer,
                    especially when it comes to videogames. Since
                    they are trending in the market as well as my
                    passion for playing games allign, I would want
                    to invest as much time as needed in this department
                    so that I may make a game that is amazing in its own
                    way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another one is to live a stable life, where I can be whoever
                    I want to be.
